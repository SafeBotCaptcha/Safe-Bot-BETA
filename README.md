This code implements a security CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) functionality for a website. CAPTCHAs are used to ensure that users are real humans and not automated scripts that could abuse the website.

The webpage displays a series of numbers in random arrangement, with one of the numbers being the sum of two other numbers. The user is prompted to click on the correct number to confirm their humanity. If the user selects the correct number three times in a row, the CAPTCHA is considered passed.

The code also utilizes color coding to highlight the correct number and improve user interaction. Additionally, after three successful selection attempts, the display of the webpage is terminated, and instead, custom code is shown.

# Next Release will have:
- Multi language support
- Better design
